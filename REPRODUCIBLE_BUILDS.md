# Reproducible Builds Setup

## Critical: Poetry Lock File Missing

This repository is missing `poetry.lock`, which is essential for reproducible builds and security.

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Generate lock file**:
   ```bash
   poetry lock
   ```

2. **Commit lock file**:
   ```bash
   git add poetry.lock
   git commit -m "add: poetry.lock for reproducible builds"
   ```

## Security Impact

Without `poetry.lock`:
- ❌ Builds are not reproducible
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities may go undetected
- ❌ Different environments may have different dependency versions
- ❌ Supply chain attacks are easier

With `poetry.lock`:
- ✅ Exact dependency versions locked
- ✅ Security scanning can detect specific vulnerable versions
- ✅ Reproducible builds across all environments
- ✅ Supply chain integrity verified

## Integration with CI/CD

The lock file enables:
- Faster CI/CD builds (no dependency resolution)
- Consistent security scanning results
- Reliable dependency vulnerability detection
- Build artifact integrity verification

**Priority: CRITICAL - Generate immediately**
