# Lock file placeholder
# This file should be generated by running: poetry lock
# 
# To generate the actual lock file:
# 1. Ensure all dependencies in pyproject.toml are correct
# 2. Run: poetry install
# 3. Run: poetry lock
# 4. Commit the generated poetry.lock file
#
# The poetry.lock file ensures reproducible builds by
# locking specific versions of all dependencies and
# their transitive dependencies.
#
# IMPORTANT: Always commit poetry.lock to version control
# for consistent dependency resolution across environments.
