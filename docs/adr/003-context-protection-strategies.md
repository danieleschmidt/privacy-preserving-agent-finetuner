# ADR-003: Context Protection Implementation Strategies

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system processes sensitive context windows and prompts that may contain PII, confidential information, or other sensitive data. We need robust context protection mechanisms that preserve utility while ensuring privacy.

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-layered context protection system** with:
- Configurable redaction strategies (PII removal, entity hashing, semantic encryption)
- Dynamic sensitivity level detection using NLP models
- Reversible transformations for authorized access scenarios
- Real-time privacy leakage monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Comprehensive protection against multiple types of sensitive data
- Configurable privacy levels based on use case requirements
- Maintains semantic meaning for model training effectiveness
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations
- Audit trail for all context transformations

### Negative Consequences

- Computational overhead for context processing (20-30ms per request)
- Potential false positives in PII detection leading to over-redaction
- Storage requirements for maintaining transformation mappings
- Complexity in handling edge cases and domain-specific entities

### Neutral Consequences

- Need for regular model updates for PII detection accuracy
- Training data requirements for domain-specific entity recognition
- Integration complexity with existing prompt processing pipelines

## Implementation Notes

### Core Protection Strategies

1. **PII Removal Strategy**
   - Named Entity Recognition using spaCy with custom privacy models
   - Pattern-based detection for structured data (SSN, credit cards, etc.)
   - Configurable entity types and sensitivity levels
   - Whitelist support for approved entities

2. **Entity Hashing Strategy**
   - Consistent hashing using HMAC-SHA256 with rotating salts
   - Preserves entity relationships while anonymizing identities
   - Configurable hash prefix preservation for utility
   - Support for k-anonymity groupings

3. **Semantic Encryption Strategy**
   - Format-preserving encryption for structured data
   - Homomorphic encryption for numerical computations
   - Context-aware key derivation based on data sensitivity
   - Support for searchable encryption when needed

### Privacy Leakage Monitoring
- Statistical analysis of output patterns for potential leakage
- Membership inference attack detection
- Automated alerts for suspicious privacy patterns
- Regular privacy audits with formal verification

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Regex-based Redaction**: Rejected due to high false positive/negative rates
2. **Full Context Encryption**: Rejected due to loss of semantic meaning for training
3. **Third-party Privacy APIs**: Rejected due to data residency and latency concerns
4. **Manual Review Process**: Rejected due to scalability limitations
