# ADR-002: Federated Learning Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs to support federated learning scenarios where multiple parties want to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. This requires secure aggregation, communication protocols, and coordination mechanisms.

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid federated learning architecture** combining:
- Local differential privacy at each client
- Secure aggregation using homomorphic encryption
- Adaptive client selection based on data quality metrics
- Byzantine fault tolerance for malicious client detection

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Enhanced privacy through local computation and minimal data sharing
- Scalable to hundreds of clients with efficient aggregation
- Robust against up to 1/3 malicious clients
- Compliance with strict data residency requirements
- Reduced communication overhead through gradient compression

### Negative Consequences

- Increased system complexity and coordination overhead
- Higher computational requirements at client nodes
- Potential for reduced model convergence quality
- Network latency sensitivity for real-time scenarios

### Neutral Consequences

- Need for client authentication and secure communication
- Additional monitoring and debugging complexity
- Backup coordination server requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Client Architecture
- Local DP-SGD training with Opacus integration
- Gradient compression using TopK sparsification
- Client health monitoring and automatic retry logic
- Secure key exchange for aggregation protocols

### Server Architecture
- Secure aggregation server with TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) support
- Byzantine fault detection using statistical anomaly detection
- Adaptive learning rate scheduling based on client participation
- Privacy budget tracking across all clients

### Communication Protocol
- gRPC with mTLS for secure client-server communication
- Differential privacy noise addition before transmission
- Gradient quantization for bandwidth optimization
- Asynchronous updates with bounded staleness

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Local DP**: Rejected due to poor convergence properties
2. **Centralized DP**: Rejected due to data residency constraints
3. **FedAvg without security**: Rejected due to privacy requirements
4. **Blockchain-based coordination**: Rejected due to scalability limitations
