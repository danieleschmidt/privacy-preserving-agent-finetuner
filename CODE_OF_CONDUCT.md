# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

  and learning from the experience

  community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct specifically applies to:
* GitHub repositories and discussions
* Issue tracking and pull requests
* Community forums and chat channels
* Conferences, meetups, and events
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Private communications between community members about project matters

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@terragon-labs.com](mailto:conduct@terragon-labs.com).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Privacy-Specific Reporting

For privacy-related violations:
* Report potential privacy breaches to [privacy@terragon-labs.com](mailto:privacy@terragon-labs.com)
* Include details about the nature of the privacy concern
* Do not include actual sensitive data in your report
* Provide steps to reproduce if applicable

### Security-Specific Reporting

For security-related violations:
* Report security vulnerabilities to [security@terragon-labs.com](mailto:security@terragon-labs.com)
* Follow responsible disclosure practices (see SECURITY.md)
* Do not publicly disclose security issues until they are resolved
* Provide clear documentation of the security concern

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### 5. Privacy/Security Violations

**Community Impact**: Exposing sensitive data, circumventing privacy protections,
or compromising security measures.

**Consequence**: Immediate temporary ban pending investigation. Depending on
severity, may result in permanent ban and potential legal action. All related
contributions may be removed and systems access revoked.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by contacting the project maintainers at
[appeals@terragon-labs.com](mailto:appeals@terragon-labs.com) with a concise
description of your concern.

Appeals will be reviewed by a panel that does not include the original decision
makers. The appeals process aims to be fair, transparent, and concluded within
30 days.

## Privacy in Enforcement

When handling Code of Conduct violations:
* Personal information of all parties will be kept confidential
* Only necessary details will be shared with relevant stakeholders
* Records will be retained according to our data retention policy
* All communications will be conducted through secure channels

## Training and Education
