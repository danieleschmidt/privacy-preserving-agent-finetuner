## Running Tests

### Quick Robustness Validation
For a quick validation of core robustness features:

```bash
cd /root/repo/privacy_finetuner/tests
python run_robustness_tests.py
```

This runs essential robustness tests and provides a quick health check.

### Comprehensive Test Suite
For thorough testing of all robustness aspects:

```bash
cd /root/repo/privacy_finetuner/tests
python test_comprehensive_robustness.py
```

This runs the complete test suite covering all edge cases and error scenarios.

### Resource Management Demo
To see the resource management system in action:

```bash
cd /root/repo/privacy_finetuner/examples
python resource_management_demo.py
```

This demonstrates all resource management capabilities with real-time monitoring.

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria
- **90%+ success rate**: Excellent robustness
- **80-89% success rate**: Good robustness with minor issues
- **70-79% success rate**: Acceptable robustness, some improvements needed
- **<70% success rate**: Significant robustness issues requiring attention

### Key Metrics Validated
- Error recovery success rate
- Resource allocation efficiency
- Security threat detection accuracy
- Privacy leakage detection precision
- System stability under stress
- Recovery time from failures

## Interpreting Results

### Test Output Format
Each test provides detailed logging including:
- Test execution status (PASS/FAIL)
- Performance metrics (duration, throughput)
- Error details and stack traces
- Resource usage statistics
- Security event logs
- Privacy compliance status

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Import Errors
Some advanced features may not be available if optional dependencies are missing:
- **Opacus**: Formal privacy guarantees
- **PyTorch**: GPU resource management
- **psutil**: System resource monitoring

This is expected and tests will gracefully skip unavailable components.

#### Resource Tests Failing
Resource management tests may fail on systems with limited resources:
- Reduce batch sizes in test parameters
- Skip GPU tests on systems without CUDA
- Adjust memory thresholds for containers

#### Timing-Sensitive Tests
Some tests depend on timing and may be flaky in CI environments:
- Circuit breaker timeout tests
- Resource monitoring intervals
- Health check frequencies

Increase timeout values if tests fail intermittently.

## Advanced Testing

### Custom Test Scenarios
Add custom test scenarios by extending the base test classes:

```python
class CustomRobustnessTest(RobustnessTestSuite):
    def test_custom_scenario(self):
        # Your custom test logic here
        assert your_condition
        self.test_results['custom_test'] = True
```

### Performance Benchmarking
The test suite includes basic performance metrics. For detailed benchmarking:

1. Run tests multiple times for statistical significance
2. Monitor system resources during test execution
3. Compare results across different configurations
4. Profile memory usage and CPU utilization

### Continuous Integration
Integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Robustness Tests
  run: |
    cd privacy_finetuner/tests
    python run_robustness_tests.py
```

## Contributing

When adding new robustness tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
3. Add appropriate logging and result tracking
4. Update this README with new test categories
5. Ensure tests are deterministic and not flaky
6. Include both positive and negative test cases

## Support

For issues with the test suite:

1. Check the detailed logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Verify system resources are sufficient for testing
4. Review the test output for guidance on failures
5. Check if optional components are available for full testing

The test suite is designed to be robust and handle missing components gracefully, so most issues are related to environment setup or resource constraints.
