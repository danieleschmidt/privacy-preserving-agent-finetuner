# Trivy ignore file for known acceptable vulnerabilities
# Add CVE IDs that are acceptable risks or false positives

# Development dependencies - low severity acceptable
# Example: CVE-2023-XXXXX (Development dependency with low impact)

# Python base image vulnerabilities that are patched in latest versions
# or not applicable to our use case

# Example entries (uncomment and customize as needed):
# CVE-2023-12345   # Low severity dev dependency
# CVE-2023-67890   # Fixed in runtime but not reflected in scan

# Privacy-specific exemptions
# (Add specific CVEs that don't apply to privacy-preserving ML workloads)

# Note: Only add entries here after careful security review
# All entries should include justification comments
# Review this file regularly and remove obsolete entries
